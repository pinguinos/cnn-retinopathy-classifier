# cnn-retinopathy-classifier
A deep learning model using CNNs to detect and classify diabetic retinopathy in retinal images

**Motivation:**
Curious what's in the domain of machine learning and figured the best way to learn is by doing a project. The project idea is inspired by existing papers on diabetic retinopathy. So here we go..

**Broad Goal:**  
The early detection of diabetic retinopathy can prevent vision loss in diabetic patients and provide accurate and timely treatments. This excercise will utilize machine learning to enhance the accuracy of early diagnosis.

**Specific Goal:**  
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has been effectively analyze medical images and identify patterns to recognize diseases. This excercise will try to develop a CNN-based model that detects signs of diabetic retinopathy from retinal images. It will then classify them by severity.
